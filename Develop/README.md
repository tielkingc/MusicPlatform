# The Sound Bar

  ## Description
  The Sound Bar has been developed to be a music centric social media platform. The Sound Bar welcomes any and all who have a likeness and fondness of music. Including but not limited, established musicians, up and coming artists, producers, fans, and anyone who might want to share in their love of music. We provide a platform for people to connect over common music likes, allow anyone to make a page to post specific music updates (for instance a new band might want to share when and where their debut performances will be taking place), and we have an events feature so you can see what events will be coming to a place near you. So, whether you are an established group, new to the scene, or just someone who likes to drive with their windows down and music blasting in their car, The Sound Bar has something for you!
